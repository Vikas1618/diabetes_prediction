# diabetes_prediction
Machine learning model for diabetes prediciton

Requirements:
Ananconda platform for data science
libraries: 
  pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost

In this prediciton model I predicted the diabetes disease prediciton
Data used is already attached in the repository

Initially I used RandomforestClaasifier for the prediction,
which gave me 77.08% model accuracy

After that I tried with xgboost library and hypertuning the parameters
than I got 79.68% model accuracy
